# euchre
This is my pet project to code the card game euchre and explore various computer player strategies. It's very much a work in progress, but eventually I'd like to invite friends and peers to code their own computer player behavior for the game. At the moment, I just want to have it as an example of code I'm fiddling with in my free time.

Right now, the game is set as a non-bidding, 4-player version of euchre. Euchre itself is a fairly regional card game, but it's not too hard to pick up.

I'm interested in exploring different AI and machine learning algorithms to see how well they do with playing euchre. Because euchre is only played with 24 cards, and any player's viable moves are 5 or less cards each trick, I'm also curious to see what kind of statistics or deterministic algorithms can handle that sample space. Processes that would be far too inefficient for a full deck of cards might be physically possible for euchre.
